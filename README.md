# Modulus-Calculator

Modulus calculator takes a recursive approach in calculating the remainder of an exponential value. Instead of using the standard a%b approach, the recursion allows the app to handle extremely large values efficiently. Accuracy of the calculator is comparable to Wolfram|Alpha with the amount of conducted tests on small and extra large values.
